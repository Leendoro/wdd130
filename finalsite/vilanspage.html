        <p2> These dastardly goup of foes are the Warlords closest companions, they act in her stead running various towns and villages in her growing empire
            they all produce a vital recourse to contribute to the warlords growing influence, Drugs, infrastructure, enertainment, history, and man power

        <h4>The lower end</h4>
        <p>These are the other members who are influenced by the Warlord in one way or another, weither its by a small agriment for trade, or protection they all are aligned in one way or another
            now these guys arnt all too bad, yes sketchy, but ultimatly they dont personaly mean anything to the Warlord
