    <h2>Battles</h3>
    <p>Thinking and designing a battle interface was a bit of a challange for me,
    I was kinda inspired by old games I used to playlike Golden sun and Earthbound

    I was thinking somthing similar to those, however this is still subject to change
  </p>

<div id="Paris" class="tabcontent">
    <img src="images/enemie_design.webp" alt="">
    <h3>Baddies</h3>
  <p>Here where some ideas of standard enemy for the starting area,
    I was going for a grundgy sorta dirty urban design for some of these guys
  </p> 
</div>

<div id="Tokyo" class="tabcontent">
    <img src="images/npc_ideas.webp" alt="">
    <h3>Non Playable Characters</h3>
  <p>every RPG has to have a wide range of people to talk too! designing NPCs was really fun for me
    these are only some ideas I had for the first area, so theres bound to me more, 
    the issue is having to actually translate these into sprites when that stage of development comes along
  </p>
</div>

<div id="Denmark" class="tabcontent">
    <img src="images/scary_enemies.webp" alt="">
    <h3>Scary Enemies</h3>
    <p>Deadworld was built in mind with horror, I was pretty facinated how I could make a game scary but also funny at the same time
        when designing the characters, enemies, and story, I felt like everything has been already done before,
        so how could I make my idea unique?

        Horror games have been on the uprise and I myself found a weird facination with the frighting aspects of media, it felt kinda interesting
        with these seemingly cutesy characters contrast with frighting designs
    </p>

      <h3>More ideas</h3>
    <p>Heres just some ideas I had for some characters, how characters move, act, personality, just some ideas

            <h2>Actually Programing</h2>
            <p>Im no expert in computers, im really just a novice in these things
                a lot of my inspirations come from the greats before me.
                Indie game developers like Toby Fox from undertale and Daiskue Amaya who made Cave Story by himself
                those two where novice developers whos creations and storys touched the hearts of thousands,
                i hope that my ideas can be like theres, atleast a little bit!

            <h2>Teams</h2>
            <p>Ive had some friends express intrest in helping me out, though im in college right now and I dont expect to go into game
                development full time, I've commited myself to this as my passion project, I dont think Deadworld will come out anythime soon
                its still just in the planning stage at the moment, but given enough time I belive ill be able to make somthing my childhood self would have gone crazy over!

                If your interested we can even collaberate! Just contact me here
